Hi, my name is **Jiajun Huang (ÈªÑÂòâ‰øä)**. I will be joining the University of South Florida (USF) as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2025 and am [recruiting](https://jiajunhuang1999.github.io/markdown/) multiple Ph.D. students. I am currently a CS Ph.D. candidate at the [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu) supervised by Dr. [Zizhong Chen](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~chen/superlab/people.html), and I will be graduating in June 2025. I have also been a long-term research intern at the [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org) team and [SZ](https://github.com/szcompressor) team in the [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov), where I have collaborated with Dr. [Sheng Di](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~shdi/), Dr. [Yanfei Guo](https://www.anl.gov/profile/yanfei-guo), Dr. [Rajeev Thakur](https://web.cels.anl.gov/~thakur/), and Dr. [Franck Cappello](https://www.anl.gov/profile/franck-cappello).

I am the founder of [ZCCL.org](https://zccl.org), an initiative developed in collaboration with scientists at Argonne National Laboratory. [ZCCL.org](https://zccl.org) is dedicated to advancing both compression and communication and has introduced the first compression-accelerated collective communications library--[ZCCL](https://github.com/ZCCLorg/zccl.git), enabling direct communication and computation with compressed data. You can explore my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lv5EK6AAAAAJ&hl). Feel free to reach out to me at jhuan380(at)ucr.edu.

### <span style="color: rgb(52, 152, 219);">Job opportunities</span>

I am actively recruiting 3‚Äì4 highly motivated Ph.D. students with full scholarships to join my research group. Areas of focus include high-performance computing and communication, high-performance deep learning, parallel & distributed computing, and big data management & analytics.
