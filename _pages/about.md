Hi, my name is **Jiajun Huang (黄嘉俊)**. I will be joining the **University of South Florida (USF)** as an **Assistant Professor** in **Fall 2025**, and I am currently **[hiring multiple Ph.D. students](https://jiajunhuang1999.github.io/markdown/)**. I lead the **High <u>P</u>erformance & <u>I</u>ntelligence Lab** (**Pi Lab** or **π Lab**), where we focus on building high-performance systems for large-scale artificial intelligence and scientific applications.

I am the founder of [ZCCL.org](https://zccl.org), an initiative developed in collaboration with scientists at Argonne National Laboratory. [ZCCL.org](https://zccl.org) is dedicated to advancing both compression and communication and has introduced the first compression-accelerated collective communications library--[ZCCL](https://github.com/ZCCLorg/zccl.git), enabling direct communication and computation with compressed data. You can explore my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lv5EK6AAAAAJ&hl). Feel free to reach out to me at jiajunhuang(at)usf.edu.
