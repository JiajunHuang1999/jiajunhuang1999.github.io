### About the Advisor
Jiajun Huang will join the College of AI, Cybersecurity, and Computing at the University of South Florida (USF) as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2025 and is recruiting **2-3 Ph.D. students** for Spring 2026 and Fall 2026. Jiajun earned his Bachelor's degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) and the University of Glasgow (First-Class Honors) in 2021 and received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Riverside (2022-2025). His research interests span **high-performance computing and communication**, **high-performance deep learning**, **parallel & distributed computing**, and **big data management & analytics**.
He has published over ten papers in **top-tier** computer systems conferences such as **SC**, **ICS**, **IPDPS**, and **SIGMOD**, and won the **First Place Award** in the ACM Student Research Competition at SC'23. He actively collaborates with **U.S. national laboratories**, and admitted students will have access to some of the world's most advanced supercomputers, including **Frontier (world's 2nd fastest)**, **Aurora (world's 3rd fastest)**, and **NVIDIA supercomputers**. Exceptional students will also have the opportunity to intern at national labs during the summer, working alongside leading scientists on cutting-edge research.

### About USF & Tampa
